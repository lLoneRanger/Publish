            Otto Hahn (1879–1968) was a German chemist who was a pioneer in the
            field of radiochemistry. He is referred to as the father of nuclear
            chemistry. Working with Lise Meitner at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
            for Chemistry in the building that now bears their names, they
            discovered isotopes of the radioactive elements radium, thorium,
            protactinium and uranium. He also discovered the phenomena of atomic
            recoil and nuclear isomerism, and pioneered rubidium–strontium
            dating. In 1938, Hahn, Meitner, Otto Robert Frisch and Fritz
            Strassmann discovered nuclear fission, for which Hahn alone was
            awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He worked on the German
            nuclear program during World War II and at the end of the war he was
            arrested by the Allied forces and detained in Farm Hall. After the
            war, he became the founding president of the Max Planck Society and
            one of the most influential and respected citizens of post-war West
            Germany. (Full article...)

            The flag of the United States from 1959 to 1960, with 49 stars,
            representing the 49 states of the union at the time. Following the
            admission of Alaska as the 49th state on January 3, 1959, a new star
            was added to the flag on July 4, 1959. The flag was in use until
            July 4, 1960, when Hawaii was admitted as the 50th state and a new
            flag design with 50 stars was adopted. (Full article...)
